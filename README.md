The repository contains the solutions to DSA Assignement in DSA Lab (CS2094D) for Winter Semester 2019-20

## To Run A Program

Say we want to run Q1 in Assignment 1.

```
git clone https://github.com/aneeshsharma/DSA_Assignment
cd DSA_Assignment/A1
gcc Q1.c -o Q1.o
./Q1.o < Q1_in.txt
```

The file `Q1_in.txt` contains a sample test case for Q1.

All the programs assume that the input is taken from `stdin` and output is given to `stdout`
